"""The Motor — action execution for the experiential core.

Executes actions from CognitiveOutput: external speech, memory writes,
goal proposals, and tool calls. Every action produces a feedback percept
that is injected back into the sensorium, closing the sensorimotor loop.

The motor is the body's effectors. It carries out the entity's intentions.
When the entity decides to speak, the motor makes it heard. When it decides
to remember, the motor makes it persist. And in every case, the entity
*perceives* that it acted — actions are not fire-and-forget.

Design principles:
  - Every action produces a feedback percept (sensorimotor loop).
  - Speech output is handler-based — the motor emits, interfaces listen.
  - The motor does not decide what to do. The LLM decides. The motor executes.
  - Failure is also perceived — a failed action is still an experience.

Aligned with PLAN.md Phase 3: Sensorium + Motor.
